- 1) Introduction: Research question
	- *Middlemarch* on aphorism, novel selection
- 2) Methodology 
	- a) creating the corpus
	- b) the text-matcher algorithm 
- 3) Discussion: parts of the novel 
	- a) 1st half vs. 2nd half; most/least quoted of 8 Books
		- Meta-discussion about visualization choices & binning, describing visualization choices for non-digital humanist readers
	- b) Which chapters are most/least quoted
	        - discuss normalising by chapter length (only for word counts?)
		- Chapter 20 
	- c) Which paragraphs (within Chapter 20) are most/least quoted
		- Annotated edition? Jokey footnote
	- d) Diachronic
	        - discuss normalising for number of articles/quotes per decade
		- The rise and fall of chapter 15, this way of talking about the value of a diachronic analysis 
			- Compare diachronic view with a synchronic heat map  
- 4) Discussion: insights into the field
	- a) Distinctive keywords (lemmatized)
	- b) Specialist journals vs. nonspecialist
- 5) Extension to other critical traditions
	- a) Sociology of literature

		- Journals breakdown of synchronic analysis? 
	- b) Theories of reception
	        - Jauss and Iser
		- Compagnon

# Rough word counts

1)     500
2a)    500
b)     500
3)     2000
4)     2000
5a)    1000
b)     1000
conc:  500

TOTAL: 8000 words

## Sources and graphs ##

2a) Stats about corpus: total no of items, no of actual articles, nos broken down per year, average+range of words per item

2b) Overview of matches: total no matches+words, average+range of matches+words per article, average+range of words per match

3a-b) matches+word counts per chapter, raw data and normalised for chapter length

- bar chart of 8 Books
- heat map of chapters (normalised for length)

3c) word-by-word frequencies for Ch20 plus data for where paragraph breaks occur

- histogram of chapter 20 frequencies (per paragraph? per word?)
- screenshot of text browser

3d) diachronic breakdown of data from 3a; specific quotes and article sources for Ch15

- diachronic heat map of chapters (normalised for length)

4a) TBC

- no graph?

4b) TBC

- graph TBC


## To Do: ##

- Clearly articulate our research question
- What we need to make sure we have to move forward:
	- A complete set of results by quotations based on number of quotes, not on word count 
	- A complete set of result by number of words
	- A complete set of results, by number of words, normalized by chapter length
	- The heat map with normalized number of words, synchronic
	- The heat map with normalized number of words, diachronic
	- List of the top 25 keywords, synchronic and diachronic
	- Redo specialist/nonspecialist based on number of words, normalized per chapter
		- complete data set of those results 
		- Compare chapter 20
		- What's the most quoted chapter in the specialist journals?
		- Decide on visualization (split bar chart or current visualization) 
- Questions:
	- Are keywords weighted by frequency or not? if not, then, these need to be weighted by frequency



## Cut Sections ##

-  Visualization: the question of how to visualize
	- Have this in the section the issues of how to represent it -- ALSO methodological
	- a way of bringing in non-digital people into the paper? 
	- the bin and unit sizes 
- Later, with Stanford 
	- [4] Discuss how to bring their corpus together with ours
- What's our timeline for the collaborative meeting?
- Topics to discuss with sSanford 
	- Questions for synchronizing
		-  use same text matcher?
		- use same divisions/segmentation?
	- Chapters? even chunks
	- How do we want to handle the eta component in the paper?
