## *Middlemarch* Methods Paper Fall 2018-Spring 2019

### Brainstorm

Application of text reuse detection - not just for plagiarism, also for legitimate quotation.

Comparable projects: JSTOR's Shakespeare text-matcher; Viral Texts network - detecting patterns of *hidden* citation in poems.

Nod to idea that we're turning attention away from *literary* texts to *critical* texts

Innovations of this text matcher:

- extremely forgiving of noise

- two-pass matching left and right (fuzzy matching using Levenstein distance)

- Lancaster stemmer for changing grammatical categories

- healing hyphenations: dealing with OCR

Give examples of what each refinement of the methodology allows the matcher to find that it would otherwise miss.

Corpus - boundedness of the collection we're applying the text-matcher to. Generated by JSTOR using a keyword search for Middlemarch. How we reduced from 6000 to 2000ish items.

Another corpus questions when dealing with results: what counts as a significant sample size?

Visualisations - earlier versions of the heat map. Why did we choose the version we chose? Text browser refinements.

Bigger picture for humanities - studying relationship between primary texts and scholarly afterlife in many other disciplines, e.g. sociology, anthropology, history (we have a list somewhere).
