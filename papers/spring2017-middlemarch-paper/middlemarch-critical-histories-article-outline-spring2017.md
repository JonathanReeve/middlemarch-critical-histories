## *Middlemarch* Critical Histories Spring 2017 Article Outline ##

It sounds like we have the makings of 3 different papers: 

1) a methods writeup for a like JoDH 
2) a PMLA, ELH general article, 
3) a press release for CU journalism

Old: Overview for LLC papers: aiming for 9,000 words
New: aiming for more general journals, (eg ELH, NLH, PMLA)

- 1) Introduction: Research question
	- *Middlemarch* on aphorism, novel selection: Milan 
- 2) Methodology [make this shorter for our generalist article; break out into a separate "methodology" standalone article]
	- a) creating the corpus: Jonathan
	- b) the text-matcher algorithm: Jonathan
- 3) Discussion: parts of the novel 
	- a) 1st half vs. 2nd half; most/least quoted of 8 Books: Milan
		- Meta-discussion about visualization choices & binning, describing visualization choices for non-digital humanist readers
		- Dip back into citing the actual texts from our corpus of scholarship:  include one work that is an outlier to the ""more frequently cited first half," dip in to analyze the particular text of one exemplar work of scholarship
	- b) Which chapters are most/least quoted: Milan
	        - discuss normalising by chapter length (only for word counts?)
		- Make a graph of the composite of ALL chapters (do the beginnings or endings of chapters get more attention)
		- Chapter 20 
	- c) Which paragraphs (within Chapter 20) are most/least quoted: Sierra
		- Annotated edition? Jokey footnote
		- Point out that even within a very frequently cited chapter like chpater 20, it's really only paragraphs, and even sentences and parts of sentences within paragraphs that are being quoted. Most of chapter 20 looks like the rest of the novel, only a few paragraphs that are quoted
		- Our theoretical intervention: the importance of quotation relying on PARTS of sentences
		- Read the single paragraph in all 16 or so articles that quote "roar on the other side of silence" paragraph in Chapter 20.
	- d) Diachronic: Jonathan? + Sierra outline
	        - discuss normalising for number of articles/quotes per decade
		- The rise and fall of chapter 15, this way of talking about the value of a diachronic analysis 
			- Compare diachronic view with a synchronic heat map  
- 4) Discussion: Analysis of the language of quotations (synchronic analysis)
	- a) The uses of abstraction: looking at distinctive keywords, specifically the frequency of abstract, generic nouns (not lemmatized and lemmatized). "life" vs "lives" as an interesting point of analysis: Jonathan
	- b) Specialist journals vs. nonspecialist: Sierra 
	- [NOTE: be careful about using the word "keyword" to describe MDWs; clarify what we mean by most frequently cited words]
	- [NOTE: include more quotations from our critics peppering this with quotation with works of criticism]
- 5) Extension to other critical traditions
	- a) Sociology of literature: Sierra
		- Thinking about the received practices of citation (Bourdieu): 
		- What are the practices of scholarly citation (eg tacit knowledge about what is already quoted; what are "canonical" quotations, proportion of frequently cited to relatively infrequently cited quotations) 
		- Journals breakdown of synchronic analysis? 
	- b) Theories of reception
	        - Ingarden and Iser: Milan
		- Compagnon: Jonathan	
- Conclusion

TOTAL: 8000 words

## Sources and graphs ##

2a) Stats about corpus: total no of items, no of actual articles, nos broken down per year, average+range of words per item

2b) Overview of matches: total no matches+words, average+range of matches+words per article, average+range of words per match

3a-b) matches+word counts per chapter, raw data and normalised for chapter length

- bar chart of 8 Books
- heat map of chapters (normalised for length)

3c) word-by-word frequencies for Ch20 plus data for where paragraph breaks occur

- histogram of chapter 20 frequencies (per paragraph? per word?)
- screenshot of text browser

3d) diachronic breakdown of data from 3a; specific quotes and article sources for Ch15

- diachronic heat map of chapters (normalised for length)

4a) TBC

- no graph?

4b) TBC

- graph TBC


## To Do: ##

- Clearly articulate our research question
- What we need to make sure we have to move forward:
	- A complete set of results by quotations based on number of quotes, not on word count 
	- A complete set of result by number of words
	- A complete set of results, by number of words, normalized by chapter length
	- The heat map with normalized number of words, synchronic
	- The heat map with normalized number of words, diachronic
	- List of the top 25 keywords, synchronic and diachronic
	- Redo specialist/nonspecialist based on number of words, normalized per chapter
		- complete data set of those results 
		- Compare chapter 20
		- What's the most quoted chapter in the specialist journals?
		- Decide on visualization (split bar chart or current visualization) 
- Questions:
	- Are keywords weighted by frequency or not? if not, then, these need to be weighted by frequency



## Cut Sections ##

-  Visualization: the question of how to visualize [This might be worth incorporating into a methods article]
	- Have this in the section the issues of how to represent it -- ALSO methodological
	- a way of bringing in non-digital people into the paper? 
	- the bin and unit sizes 
- Later, with Stanford 
	- [4] Discuss how to bring their corpus together with ours
- What's our timeline for the collaborative meeting?
- Topics to discuss with sSanford 
	- Questions for synchronizing
		-  use same text matcher?
		- use same divisions/segmentation?
	- Chapters? even chunks
	- How do we want to handle the eta component in the paper?
