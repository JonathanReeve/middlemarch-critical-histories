#"The very fact of frequency": what we can learn from 2,000 scholarly articles on *Middlemarch*

## Introduction

Decades of research in linguistics has shown that when a large enough collection of texts (a corpus) is analysed, patterns emerge which aren't accessible at a smaller scale. In some cases these patterns confirm our intuitions and expectations, in other cases they are entirely unexpected or counter-intuitive. This study began with a simple question: what patterns might be revealed by analysing a large corpus of literary scholarship? Would it provide empirical confirmation of our own sense of the trends in literary scholarship, or would it reveal dynamics shaping the field and its practices of which scholars aren't consciously aware?

Literary texts are one of the most important raw materials of literary scholarship, and as such their deployment within a scholarly article by means of quotation struck us as a rewarding place to search for patterns. This approach has the virtue of being computationally relatively straightforward, broadly applicable across this genre of writing and offering results which directly reflect (in aggregate) the familiar activities of literary scholarship. We began this project curious to see what citation practices would look like at a scale beyond that which mere mortals can perceive, and approached the results not with hypotheses but with questions. Which parts of a text have been cited most frequently? Which parts haven't? Have these patterns changed over time? Can we detect a life-cycle for certain passages which rise and fall in popularity over time? Can this be connected to major movements within the field (e.g. feminist criticism, deconstruction) or even to a specific critic?

In reflecting on these questions, George Eliot's novel *Middlemarch* stood out as being an especially rich test case. Its first chapter compares the heroine's outstanding qualities to the way a Bible quotation stands out within a piece of journalism, and the novel itself repeatedly thematises more abstract questions of how a whole can be made up of heterogeneous parts, including ones that come from elsewhere (the newcomer Lydgate's struggle to find a place within the local community, for instance). Moreover, as Leah Price's work has shown, *Middlemarch*'s afterlife has also been characterised by unusually intensive quotation practices, starting with anthologisers of the time who extracted the novel's eminently quotable aphorisms into books such as *Wise, Witty and Tender Sayings of George Eliot* (even including, ironically enough, a plea against decontextualised wisdom such as: ".........").

Other practical considerations made *Middlemarch* seem ideal. Firstly, its canonical status within studies of English literature, ensuring the availability of a relatively large sample of articles. Secondly, its length: unlike short hyper-canonical works such as a Shakespeare sonnet, where every word is likely to have been quoted many times, novels in general, and long novels in particular, pose more acute problems for quotation, where a small part has to stand for a much larger whole. Whereas Franco Moretti has refered to the 99% of forgotten non-canonical literature of the past as "the great unread" (REF), we are curious to consider how large swathes of even a canonical novel can be "unread", as far as literary scholarship is concerned at least. Finally, on a practical level, *Middlemarch* occupies a sweet spot of being out of copyright, which facilitates acquiring a digital text, and yet not so old as to raise problems of variant spellings. It also has a relatively straightforward editorial history, so that we haven't had to keep track of multiple versions.

The first section of this article offers an account of our methodology, describing the construction of our corpus, the algorithm we created to detect quotations and the techniques we developed to visualise the data. The second section presents our results and discusses possible explanations for some of the most striking patterns we found. Specifically, we focus on......... . Finally, the article concludes by reflecting on the implications of this research for literary studies more broadly, in particular the contribution it makes to the sociology of scholarly activity.
