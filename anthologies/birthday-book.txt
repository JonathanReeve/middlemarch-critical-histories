In

courtship everything is regarded as provisional
and preliminary, and the smallest sample of virtue
or accomplishment is taken to guarantee delightful
stores which the broad leisure of marriage will reveal.
But the door-sill of marriage once crossed, expecta

Having once
embarked on your marital voyage, it is impossible
not to be aware that you make no way and that the
